These were the long days. We drove most of the time, and cut out a few stops to scrape some more hang out time later down the road.

We camped in one of the most magical places ever, which included a pond and a fire, and countless tiger lilies. 🏕🌺🏊‍

We were woken up by mosquitos a few nights.

Saw Mt. Rushmore.

All in all, it was fantastic, even if it was a bit of a slog.
