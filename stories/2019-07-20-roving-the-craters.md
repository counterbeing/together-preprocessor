I contacted an old friend to see if we could drop in on him. It turned out he was playing a concert at [Craters of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craters_of_the_Moon_National_Monument_and_Preserve), a national monument. It's a really geologically fascinating place, as well as a very unique landscape.

Had a super fun evening.
