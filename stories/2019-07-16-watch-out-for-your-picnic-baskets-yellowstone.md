We got to spend about three days around Yellowstone. It was quite hectic trying to find a place to camp in the beginning. We camped just outside of the park and went in at dawn, we still waited in a line to camp at Indian Creek Campground. But we got in with enough time, and found ourselves a nice little spot.

There were a few reports of a grizzly around camp! Apparently he was starting to cause some trouble, including pouncing on a tent. We kept all the food locked down, and thankfully the only time we saw a bear was at a distance from the road.
