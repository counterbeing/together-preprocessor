White sands was quite the spectacle. It really lends itself to photography. You’re free to roam around the dunes as you please. The geography feels incredibly foreign. Definitely pop in here if you’re in the neighborhood.

When we arrived, we had planned on seeing if we could camp in the park, but that idea was quickly put to rest as the military had the camping shut down for the evening. Apparently they might have been doing some bomb testing nearby. But, we found another fantastic place to sleep all the same!
