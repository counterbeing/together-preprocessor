Just about the time we were leaving West Virginia, my father's 60th birthday was on the horizon. The neighbors managed to put together a really nice little surprise party complete with lobsters.

We made it out on a bunch of little bike rides, and even a couple of runs.

We celebrated my father's actual birthday on a pristine summer afteroon in the back yard with clouds and snacks.
