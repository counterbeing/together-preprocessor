description: Our first time visiting the red river gorge. Got to the historic Miguel's pizza and did a little climbing.

This was our first time seeing [Miguel’s Pizza]([https://www.miguelspizza.com](https://www.miguelspizza.com/)). We arrived late in the evening and found a place to set up camp, which is really not much more than a space in a parking lot, if you’re camping in a vehicle. But hey, for $3 you really can’t complain. The pizza is good, and the proximity to world class climbing is incredible.

It’s no surprise you see Miguel’s t-shirts at crags all around the world.
