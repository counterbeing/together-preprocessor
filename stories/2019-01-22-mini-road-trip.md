Katie and I took off to see her parents for a couple of days. It was just a few
days, but it wound up being really fun. A bunch of podcasts and music. Got to
meet the folks. Scenic highway in both directions.

It was a little vacation. Just passed the time with a run, some cooking, and an
afternoon of rock climbing. It was Katieâ€™s first time ever climbing out doors. She did great, she made her way up a 5.8 without too much trouble. She looked a bit worse for wear by the top, but then we headed on out.
