Katie and I took off to see her parents for a couple of days. It was just a few
days, but it wound up being really fun. A bunch of podcasts and music. Got to
meet the folks. Scenic highway in both directions.

It was a little vacation. Just passed the time with a run, some cooking, and an
afternoon of rock climbing.
