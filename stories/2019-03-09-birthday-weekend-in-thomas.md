Cross country skiing is really just code for falling down a mountain. This was Katie's birthday, we decided to head to the [Purple Fiddle](https://purplefiddle.com) to stay the weekend.

Katie wanted to go cross country skiing, and so we did. It was the very last day of the year that the resort would be open, but we managed to go for a nice little jaunt up the hill without getting stuck in the mud. By the time we were about a quarter of the way up the hill there was plenty of snow, and we were able to glide more smoothly.

On the way back down, I got completely destroyed. I must have fallen 20 or so times.
