We paused for a moment to focus on apartmeent hunting in Charleston. We stayed
at a rather luxurious Airbnb for a couple of nights. We made it out on a couple of runs, and explored what was around. We even made it to my *first ever* Waffle House. 🥞

We may or may not have listened to “Wagon Wheel” while rolling through Johnson City, Tennessee.
