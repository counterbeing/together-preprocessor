This place was spectacular, and without having any idea we nailed the timing.

We showed up mid-week expecting to find some place to camp, but there was one.
Perhaps the timing could have been better in this particular regard. So we wound
up in the cute little town that is Terlingua. It's got an artsy individualist
flair, but comes with a warning to not fuck it up. There were stickers
everywhere saying things like "Don't Marfa my Terlingua". On the corkboard at
the gas station, the most prominently posted thing was someone offering to
purchase used water systems.

We went for a quick dip into the park (wich also included a dip). We lost a bit
of time to the park, which really didn't bother us in the slightest, but for the
fact that we still had to figure out camping. We wandered into [Rancho
Topanga](http://www.ranchotopanga.com/) after hours and set up a rather cold and
windy camp for a bowl of ramen.

After a nights rest we were delighted to find warm showers. Went to settle up,
and got called a tresspasser. Seemed a bit odd to me for a campground. Either
they were teasing, or they were genuinely offended that we'd checked ourselves
in after hours. You win some you lose some, but maybe take note if you're going
camping there.
