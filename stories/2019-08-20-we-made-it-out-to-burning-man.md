This was Katie's inaugural burn. Burning Man is a sort of arts festival, or perhaps a social experiment in a temporary society. Whatever you wan't to call it, it's one hell of a stimulating week.

I drove to San Francisco, and Katie flew down a bit later to meet me. We spent the final days in constant prep mode. We had food shopping to do, and lot's of arts and crafts.

Namely we were working on a [scarf project](https://github.com/counterbeing/liteswarm), of which there are photos below. The idea is that all of the scarves communicate over radio signals to synchronize LED animations. They're really fun for a group to play with.

Mac and Lisa hosted us, and we all kicked butt to make it one of the best burns ever.

Thanks to everyone out there who made all of the art, it really couldn't have been better.
