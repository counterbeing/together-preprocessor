Rather than heading to the north as we‚Äôd planned, we circumvented some nasty weather by staying to the south. Somehow we snagged a really nice little AirBnB for a few days. It was a *very* welcome break from all of the driving. The cold weather and rain from the past few days had really made the camping much more difficult than we tend to prefer for a longer stint. 

So while we were in the big easy, we took the bikes off the roof and cruised around. We made it out on a couple of very sweaty runs. We saw a gigantic fire of an old historic building, which was pretty sad. We ate all of the things you‚Äôre supposed to.

We wandered around bourbon street for some music and drinks. We went to a really nice little jazz club to watch a set. It felt like we ticked all of the boxes! üçªüé∑‚úÖ

I can imagine coming back here at some point, perhaps for a bit longer.
