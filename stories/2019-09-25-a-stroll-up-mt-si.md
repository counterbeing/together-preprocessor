This was just a day hike after we were both getting over a cold. We made pretty good time up to the top, and even did a scramble up to the very summit. A first time for both of us to the very top, maybe the tenth or so time for Katie on the hike. It would be more climbing than hiking if it wasnâ€™t for all of the switchbacks.

Apparently people train to go up Mt. Rainier here.
