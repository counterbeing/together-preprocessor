We woke up at 3:30AM to hit the road. This was our first time on the road
together in our two separate vehicles. We'd been planning how everything would
work, but not incredibly meticulously. Here we were, in freezing conditions, in
the dark of morning, throwing the last few things in the car.

We left a couple of house plants in the care of Sheila. I forgot the cheese I
spent precious moments slicing in the refridgerator. But here we were, on the
road, after a solid four hours of sleep.

We followed the Rio Grande south for a couple of hours, just getting into the
rhythem of being on the road for the first time together. We chatted on our new
radios about the moon as we left snowy Santa Fe, and I broadcasted a few
podcasts from the radio transmitter.

We headed straight for [Bosque del
Apache](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bosque_del_apache/), and arrived just before
dawn. We weren't sure at first if the conditions were going to be good. Were
there going to be birds? Was the sunrise going to be alright?

It was all amazing, even in a half asleep stupor.
