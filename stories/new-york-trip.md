We went to New York to surprise Laura for her birthday. That all went off without a hitch. On the way there we camped for an evening. We'd never seen so many deer on a road. We probably saw 30 deer in the space of an hour, and had to slow down many times. We stayed at a [fantastic little site](https://www.hipcamp.com/pennsylvania/the-pond/overland-camping-at-the-pond) we found on hipcamp, which was complete with a pond, and stocked with firewood. We didn't get to use the firewood as it was raining on and off and the hour was already late, but we woke up to lush green grassy area, dotted with trees.
