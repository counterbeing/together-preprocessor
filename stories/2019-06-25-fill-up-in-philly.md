We popped off to visit Matt and Becca for a few days. They showed us a great time, including:

- 🌭 Definitely the best cheese-steak of our lives.
- 🍦Italian ice in the hot sun.
- 🍳Scrapple for breakfast.
- 🚲Biking around the city.

I suppose it was a lot of tasting things. Great to have such good tour guides. Meanwhile, Matt got me fitted for a suit for his wedding.
